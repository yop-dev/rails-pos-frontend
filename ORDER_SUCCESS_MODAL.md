## Technical Implementation

### Props & Events

#### Props
```typescript
{
  show: boolean                    // Controls modal visibility
  order: Order                     // Order data from API
  shippingMethod?: string          // Shipping method label
  paymentMethod?: string           // Payment method label  
  shippingFee?: number            // Shipping fee in cents
  convenienceFee?: number         // Convenience fee in cents

}
```

#### Events
```typescript
{
  'close': []                     // Close modal
  'view-order': [orderId: string] // Navigate to order detail
  'create-new': []                // Start new order
}
```

### Data Mapping

#### Shipping Methods
- `standard` → "Standard Delivery"
- `express` → "Express Delivery"

- `bank_transfer` → "Bank Transfer"

## User Experience Flow

### Before Implementation
1. User clicks "Place Order"
2. Simple success notification appears
3. Immediate redirect to Order Manager
4. User has to navigate to order details to see information

### After Implementation
1. User clicks "Place Order"
2. **Comprehensive modal appears with all order details**
3. User can review all information immediately
4. User chooses their next action:
   - View full order details
   - Create another order
   - Close and return to order manager

## Error Handling

### Missing Data Protection
- Handles missing order items gracefully
- Shows fallback text for missing product names
- Conditional display of optional sections (delivery address, shipping method)
- Empty state message for orders with no items

### Edge Cases

- **Missing Customer Data**: Shows "N/A" for missing fields

## Styling & Responsiveness

- **Modal Overlay**: Semi-transparent background
- **Responsive Layout**: Adjusts from mobile to desktop
- **Success Theme**: Green color scheme for positive reinforcement
- **Clear Hierarchy**: Information organized in logical sections

- Responsive text sizing

## Benefits

1. **Immediate Confirmation**: Users see order success immediately
2. **Complete Information**: All order details in one place
3. **Reduced Support**: Customers can verify order details instantly
4. **Better UX**: Clear next steps with action buttons
